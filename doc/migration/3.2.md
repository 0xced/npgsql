# Migrating from 3.1 to 3.2

* Npgsql's custom logging API has been replaced with [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging). While this opens up lots of new possibilities and makes everything much simpler, if you used Npgsql logging in pre-3.2 you will have to change your code. See the [logging docs](../logging.md) for more info.
* The `Buffer Size` connection string parameter has been replaced by `Read Buffer Size` and `Write Buffer Size`.
